<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` Y2K is a concept I borrowed from TikTok as it stands for the year 2000 and it can be loosely interpreted depending on the manner it was used. In my case I used Y2K to test the amount of pop culture that I assume most Y2Ks would be aware of. Thus I chosen these categories as these are the categories that I am invested in as a 2Kayer. The app was styled and designed with my personal interest that I gained from different inspirations.
